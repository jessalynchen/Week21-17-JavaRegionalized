# Week21-17JavaRegionalize
Create a Meal Tracker Backend  For this week's assignment, you will design and implement the back-end for a meal tracking application. The application will allow users to keep track of the meals they eat throughout the day; the foods they eat with each meal; and what percentage of their meals are "complete". 


My main meals (healthy or not) are Salad, Candy, and Icecream. You can check the nutritional information in the Meal in my source (src) files.
